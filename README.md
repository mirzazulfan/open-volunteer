# Open Volunteer

## Current Status
Open Volunteer is **pre-alpha**.

## About Open Volunteer
Open Volunteer is a community based Volunteer Management System. It came from a need to plan local community events and recruit the volunteers to make the events happen. I wish to expand if beyond events in the future.

## About the Creator
My name is [Ben Hovinga](https://github.com/benhovinga) and I am a novice PHP programmer. I am taking on this project as a real test of my abilities and also to learn about how community open source projects are made. I plan to impliment tools very new to me and I invite anyone with interest and/or experience to help out with the project in any way.
